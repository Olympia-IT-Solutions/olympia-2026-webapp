                  <strong>Strictly Necessary cookies</strong> enable you to navigate the Digital Platforms and, in some markets, enable the provision of an optimised service. These cookies are necessary for the Digital Platforms to function and cannot be switched off in our systems. They are usually set in response to actions made by you which amount to a request for services, such as setting your privacy preferences, logging in or filling in forms. In some markets, these cookies are set so that we may review the performance of the Digital Platforms. You can set your browser to block or alert you to these cookies, but some parts of the Digital Platforms will not then work.

                  <strong>Marketing and Advertising cookies</strong> enable the tailoring of online advertising based on your browsing activity and the location from which you access the Digital Platforms. These cookies include cookies set by our advertising partners. The cookies are used (i) to measure traffic to the Digital Platforms, (ii) for the purpose of personalising services and offering you the most relevant content, and (iii) by us and by our partners to build a profile of you and your interests and browsing activity, to determine campaign audiences that may include you or people similar to you, and to show you and other people adverts and content that are likely to be of interest to you both on Digital Platforms as well as on other sites.

                  <strong>Social Media cookies</strong> are set by social media providers and include cookies that are set by social media services where such services have been added to the Digital Platforms. For example, social media services that enable you to share Digital Platforms' content with your friends and networks. These cookies are capable of tracking your browser across websites, and enable a profile of you and your interests and browsing activity to be built. These insights are used to determine audiences (including you or people similar to you) to which relevant content and ads will be shown on other websites that you visit, such as social media platforms. This may impact the content and messages you see on other websites you visit, such as social media platforms. If you do not allow these cookies you may not be able to use or see the social media sharing tools.

          <Text mb={4}>Users in the United States may opt-out of targeted advertising cookies. For example, you may go to the Digital Advertising Alliance ("DAA") Consumer Choice Page for information about opting out of interest-based advertising and their choices regarding having information used by DAA companies. You may also go to the Network Advertising Initiative ("NAI") Consumer Opt-Out Page for information about opting out of interest-based advertising and their choices regarding having information used by NAI members.</Text>

          <Text mb={6}>Opting out from one or more companies listed on the DAA Consumer Choice Page or the NAI Consumer Opt-Out Page will opt you out from those companies' delivery of interest-based content or ads to you, but it does not mean you will no longer receive any advertising through the Digital Platforms. You may continue to receive advertisements, for example, based on the particular website that you are viewing (i.e., contextually based ads). Also, if your browsers are configured to reject cookies when you opt out on the DAA or NAI websites, your opt out may not be effective.
